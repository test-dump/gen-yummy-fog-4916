You can use Microsoft's .NET framework to build a console application.\n\nHere is an example of how to do it:\n\n1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project.\n2. Select \"Console App (.NET Core)\" as your project type. \n3. Provide a name for your project and click \"Create\".\n4. Visual Studio will generate a new project for you with some default code.\n5. Inside the `Main` function, which is the entry point for your program, you will see a line that says `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` This line of code prints the text \"Hello, World!\" to the console window.\n\nHere's how the complete code looks:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo run the program:\n\n1. Press the \"Start Debugging\" button or hit F5 on your keyboard.\n2. A console window will open and display the text \"Hello, World!\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Factors to consider:\n\nWhen building a \"Hello, World!\" console application in C#, you'll need Visual Studio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. Visual Studio is available in various versions including a free Community Edition, that can be used by students, open-source contributors, and individual developers. Professional and Enterprise editions are also available, which is useful for companies and large teams.\n\nThe \".NET Core\" part in \"Console App (.NET Core)\" stands for the .NET framework that this application will be using. .NET Core is the newer, open-source, and cross-platform framework. There are also other versions available, but .NET Core is recommended for starting new projects.\n\nThe using directive `using System;` at the beginning is used to use the System namespace in the program. This namespace includes the `Console` class which is used to write the text to the console.\n\nLastly, remember to save your project before running it. Visual Studio will typically autosave your project when you run it, but it's a good habit to manually save before running."}]
