Factors to consider:

When building a "Hello, World!" console application in C#, you'll need Visual Studio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. Visual Studio is available in various versions including a free Community Edition, that can be used by students, open-source contributors, and individual developers. Professional and Enterprise editions are also available, which is useful for companies and large teams.

The ".NET Core" part in "Console App (.NET Core)" stands for the .NET framework that this application will be using. .NET Core is the newer, open-source, and cross-platform framework. There are also other versions available, but .NET Core is recommended for starting new projects.

The using directive `using System;` at the beginning is used to use the System namespace in the program. This namespace includes the `Console` class which is used to write the text to the console.

Lastly, remember to save your project before running it. Visual Studio will typically autosave your project when you run it, but it's a good habit to manually save before running.
