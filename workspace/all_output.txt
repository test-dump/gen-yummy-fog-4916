Creating a "Hello, World!" console application in C# is simple and a perfect starting point for beginners. You can use Microsoft's .NET framework to build a console application.

Here is an example of how to do it:

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project.
2. Select "Console App (.NET Core)" as your project type. 
3. Provide a name for your project and click "Create".
4. Visual Studio will generate a new project for you with some default code.
5. Inside the `Main` function, which is the entry point for your program, you will see a line that says `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` This line of code prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console window.

Here's how the complete code looks:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

To run the program:

1. Press the "Start Debugging" button or hit F5 on your keyboard.
2. A console window will open and display the text "Hello, World!"
