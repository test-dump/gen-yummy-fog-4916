Apologies for any confusion, but I'm not able to see any code above to correct. However, if you're looking for how to create a "Hello, World!" console application in C#, here's a simple example:

```C#
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This program simply writes the string "Hello, World!" to the console window. Once compiled and run, you should see those words appear in the console. Let me know if you need further help!
